                Your eyes are my favorite place to get lost. This page is just a tiny list of all the things
                I love about them – and about the beautiful soul behind them.

                <h2>Their Color</h2>
                <p>
                    They’re this perfect mix of hazel and green – sometimes soft and warm like afternoon light,
                    sometimes deep and mysterious like a forest after rain. I could spend forever just memorizing every shade.

                <h2>The Way They Glow</h2>
                <p>
                    When you’re excited, your eyes actually sparkle. They light up a room more than any lamp or screen ever could,
                    and I always end up smiling just because you’re happy.

            <article class="eye-card glass">
                <h2>How They Soften</h2>
                <p>
                    When you’re tired, shy, or feeling a little down, your eyes turn gentle and soft.
                    I see so much kindness and vulnerability in them, and it makes me want to protect you even more.

            <article class="eye-card glass">
                <h2>How They Listen</h2>
                <p>
                    When I talk, you really listen. Your eyes stay on me, patient and focused, and in that moment
                    I feel like I’m the only person in the world that matters to you.

            <article class="eye-card glass">
                <h2>How They Love</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a special look you give me – that soft, quiet, “I love you” look without words.
                    I replay that look in my head on the hardest days, and it always makes everything better.
                </p>

                <h2>How They See Me</h2>
                <p>
                    You see the best in me, even when I don’t. Your hazel green eyes make me feel chosen, safe,
                    and truly loved – and that is the greatest gift you could ever give me.
