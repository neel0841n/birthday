                Here are a few small letters to you. You can change the text to make it even more personal,
                but I hope each one already feels like a hug in sentence form.

                <h2>To the Birthday Girl</h2>
                <p>
                    Today isn’t just another day on the calendar – it’s the day the world became softer, brighter,
                    and a lot more beautiful because you were born. I’m so grateful that of all the people on this planet,
                    I get to be the one standing beside you, celebrating you.

                <h2>To Your Heart</h2>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your patience, your warmth, your silliness, and your kindness. You always try your best,
                    even when no one notices. I notice. I appreciate every small thing you do, even the ones you think don’t matter.

                <h2>To Our Future</h2>
                <p>
                    I don’t know exactly where life will take us, but I know this: I want your hand in mine for every
                    chapter that’s coming. I want more birthdays, more late-night talks, more ordinary days that feel special
                    just because you’re there.

                <h2>To Your Hazel Green Eyes</h2>
                <p>
                    When the world feels heavy, your eyes are my safe place. They remind me that I’m loved, seen, and chosen.
                    I hope you always see yourself the way I see you: strong, gentle, and breathtaking in every possible way.
